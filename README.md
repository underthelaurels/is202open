# is202open
Code for a basic website that tells the user if the room McBryde 202 is open.
(Aka, doesn't currently have a class in it.)

McBryde 202 is the place to be for members of the CS class of 2019 subgroup, The Forge. It is our default study space, especially since the CS lounge is almost always crowded and loud. Many members of The Forge are familiar with accidentally walking into 202 when a class is in session, and our website prevents this from happening in the future. Awkwardness must be avoided at all costs. Especially if the only costs are creating a simple website.
